# REGEX PATTERNS
# works at Regexr, but re.findall() return tuples when regex has capturing groups:
# REGEX_PATTERN = r"\[(.+)?\]\(((?:\/|https?:\/\/).+)\)"
#  without capturing groups re.findall() returns a list of correspondent strings:
REGEX_PATTERN_URL_MD_WRAPPED = r"\[(?:.+)?\]\((?:\/|https?:\/\/.+)\)"
REGEX_PATTERN_URL_PARENTHESIS_WRAPPED = r"\(((?:\/|https?:\/\/).+)\)"
